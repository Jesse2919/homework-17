# Understanding the Components of a URL Regex

 Paragraph

Regular expressions, or regex, are powerful tools used to define search patterns for strings. They are particularly useful for validating input, searching for specific patterns, and performing substitutions in strings. This tutorial will break down a regex pattern used to match URLs, explaining each component in detail.

 ## Summary

The regex pattern we'll explore in this tutorial is used to match URLs. This pattern ensures that a string follows the structure of a typical web address, including optional protocols (http or https), domain names, and paths. Understanding this pattern can help in validating and parsing URLs in web applications.

/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

## Regex Components


### Anchors

Anchors are used to ensure that the regex matches the entire string from start to end.

^ asserts the position at the start of the string.
$ asserts the position at the end of the string.
### Quantifiers

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs allow you to group parts of a regex together and apply quantifiers to the group.

(...) groups multiple tokens together.
regex
/(https?:\/\/)?/


Example:

https:// (matches)
http:// (matches)
example.com (matches without protocol)

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions match any one of the characters enclosed within the brackets.

[...] matches any single character within the brackets.
[\da-z.-] matches any digit, lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen.
Example:

example (matches)
sub.example (matches)
123-example (matches)


### Character Classes

Character classes match any one of a set of characters.

\d matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).
\w matches any word character (alphanumeric plus underscore).

Example:

1 (matches)
9 (matches)

### The OR Operator

The OR operator matches one pattern or another.
 regex /(a|b)/

| separates alternative patterns.
Example:

a (matches)
b (matches)

### Flags

Flags change how the regex engine interprets the pattern.
regex /abc/i

i makes the regex case-insensitive.
g enables global matching.

### Character Escapes
Character escapes allow you to match special characters that would otherwise have a different meaning in regex.
regex /\.com/

\. matches a literal dot.
Example:

.com (matches)
example.com (matches)
